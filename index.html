            <h3>Reading Books</h3>
            <p>I like to read detective stories especially of Sherlock Holmes. When I was small I used to read all of my language text books much earlier than when the term used to start, which made reading books my habit. And now I read books of nearly every genre which I get. Be it autobiographies or stories or books on psychology, economics, social life etc.</p>

            <h3>Programming</h3>
            <p>I am a C++ programmer at heart but I do programming in python and C as well. As a child I used to watch my elder brothers coding on their laptop and discussing about the applications of programming such as building games, which inspired me a lot to take computer science as my programme for Bachelor's degree and helped me to make programming as my career.</p>

            <img class="badminton-img" src="images/badminton (2).png" alt="badminton">
            <h3>Badminton</h3>
            <p>One most interesting thing about Badminton is it gives enough exercise to keep your body fit to take on the challenges of the hectic world. I used to be loathsome guy at home because I wasn't good at other games like cricket or football. But when I watched Badminton I instantly fell for this game. As it can be played with two persons only and it didn't need expensive equipments like other sports. It only required a racquet, a shuttle cork and a playmate(usually my sister or my mother) at my disposal to start playing with it.</p>
